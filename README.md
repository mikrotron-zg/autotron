# autotron
Autotron is robocar kit by DIYKits.eu. This is software to run the car.

Autotron comes in three flavors, and this is how this repo is organized:

1) Autotron Basic
http://www.diykits.eu/products/p_10683

This autonomous robocar kit is based on Arudino Uno, Arduino Motor Shield, and ultrasonic rangefinder.
The code is in autotron_uno subdirectory.

2) Autotron Nova
http://www.diykits.eu/products/p_10747

This internet-enabled robocar is based on Croduino Nova and L298 Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver.
Arduino code is in autotron_nova subdirectory, and python client code is in top-level directory.

3) Mboard code
We also experimented with MBoard and Wee modules by ITead Studio.
Eventually we decided not to make robocar kit based on these, mostly due to higher price.
However, if you wish to do so, the code is in autotron_mboard subdirectory, and python code is the same.

Drive safe! ;)
